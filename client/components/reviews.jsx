              <p>I had the pleasure to work with Ken Mendoza for the past two years on many projects including a few residential and multiple commercial jobs. Ken is a very professional individual, always on time, and very knowledgeable about what he does. His carpet cleaning technique is unique and effective. He uses eco/environmental friendly products that doesnâ€™t leave any residue. He provides great services at a very reasonable price. Aside from Carpet cleaning, he helped me with rug cleaning and upholstery cleanings a few times. He always delivered excellent results.
              I highly recommend Ken. I will be happy to be a live or phone reference for his services if necessary.
