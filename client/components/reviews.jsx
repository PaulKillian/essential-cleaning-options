              <p>I had the pleasure to work with Ken Mendoza for the past two years on many projects including a few residential and multiple commercial jobs. Ken is a very professional individual, always on time, and very knowledgeable about what he does. His carpet cleaning technique is unique and effective. He uses eco/environmental friendly products that doesnâ€™t leave any residue. He provides great services at a very reasonable price. Aside from Carpet cleaning, he helped me with rug cleaning and upholstery cleanings a few times. He always delivered excellent results.
              I highly recommend Ken. I will be happy to be a live or phone reference for his services if necessary.

              <p>We have known Ken Mendoza for about eight years of which we started using Ken&apos;s services about five years.  He has cleaned our carpets at least once a year since, he also has cleaned grout between the floor titles and he has detailed one of our cars. He is a one man operation who puts all his energy into his work and and is extremely detailed in his work. Every project he has done for us we have receive more than we asked for. We highly recommend him.

              <p>Ken Mendoza has worked on my car a few times, and I continue to go back to him because his work is top shelf. He is professional, detailed, and his work is amazing, making my 2007 exterior brilliant and like-new with great attention to detail. Next time, I am definitely going to have him do the full detail, because I know I&apos;ll be as pleased with the interior. I highly recommend Ken to anyone who wants their car restored to a striking condition. This guy knows his stuff!

              <p>Ken has been washing and detailing my car for a number of months now.  His work has been fabulous and I have received comments on how good my car looks.  I
              have him come to my home once a month and he either washes or details my car.  I depend on him to tell me the best way to keep my car looking good.  He is
              someone I trust to take care of my car.  I would not take my car anywhere else now.  It is so convenient and it costs me less to have him come to my house
              than it did when I took my car to a car spa.  I highly recommend Ken.
